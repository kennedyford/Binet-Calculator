# Binet-Calculator

The Binet Calculator is based on a formula in Discrete Mathematics that was derived by the French mathematician Jacques Philippe Marie Binet. It uses something that is known as the "Golden Ratio". Binet's formula takes the golden ration and raises it to the power of a passed in variable and takes the floor of that number. Whatever variable one passes into this equation, it will return the number cooresponding to that place in the Fibonnacci Sequence (i. e. 1, 1, 2, 3...)

For example, If you passed the number 4 into the equation, it would return the number 3 since it is the 4th Fibonacci number.

Likewise, if you passed the number 20 into the equation, it would return the number 6765 since it is the 20th Fibonacci number.

This program is made in python and uses the TKinter GUI library.
